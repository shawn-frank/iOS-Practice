# SwiftUI Notes

I used this repo to help me practice the core concepts and foundations for building interfaces using SwiftUI. If you happen to stumble upon this page, scroll on to discover some concepts I found useful and interesting when it comes to building interfaces with SwiftUI.

## Resources I used to learn

- [Introducing SwiftUI by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui)
- [CS193P Spring 2021 - Developing applications for iOS devices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqu6BquVi2M&list=PLpGHT1n4-mAsxuRxVPv7kj4-dQYoC3VVu&ab_channel=Stanford)
- [SwiftUI for Beginners by Coding with Chris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ojC6TNwws&ab_channel=CodeWithChris)
- [100 days of SwiftUI by Hacking with Swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWZzEGwkenQ&ab_channel=PaulHudson)

## Import

- In order to use `SwiftUI` components, make sure to add `import SwiftUI` at the top of your file
- When you import `SwiftUI` and certain other frameworks in the same file, you gain access to SwiftUI-specific functionality provided by that framework. For example, when importing `SwiftUI` and `MapKit`, `MapKit` exposes `SwiftUI` specific APIs as well
